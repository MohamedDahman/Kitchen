## Kitchen Service App

    We currently spend around 10 hours per day in the refugees{code} learning hub.
    And it is starting to feel like home a bit, so it would be nice if we can cook together as well.
    As a gift to ourselves and future participants in the program, 
    we decided to do a practical project where we can schedule cooking sessions for participants. 
    This is our first real project and we hope that you also find that we are on the right we. 
    Through it we are learning front-end, backend, user experience and project management with GitHub.
    The technologies we used are: Flask, JavaScript, Jinja, SQL, HTML, CSS, Python.
    We hope our code and our kitchen will be clean :)
