## Kitchen Service App ##

Purpose: Let’s cook together, the easier way.

What’s the problem: Sharing food has a connecting function. But cooking takes time and preparation and overview. Through a simple cooking / scheduling app we can take away the pain and make sure we have at least one meal together every week.


## User Stories:
* 	As a cook, I like to pick the dish and allow people to sign up for eating.
* 	As a cook, I like to write a shopping list for others to buy.
* 	As an anti-cook, I can do the shopping because everything I touch burns down.
* 	As someone with no time this week I just want to sign up for the meal.
* 	As a cleaner I want to say thank you by promising to clean the kitchen afterwards
* 	As a normally talented person, I can sign up for cutting vegetables or helping the chef cook.
* 	As someone who cares about fairness, it’s nice to earn points for each role.
* 	As someone who’s hungry I want to see what’s on the menu this week.
* 	As someone who cares about money, I want to split up the costs between all participants.
